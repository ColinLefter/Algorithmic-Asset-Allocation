## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Our goal is to develop software for constructing an optimized portfolio of equities according to client requirements by leveraging quantitative analysis, financial modelling and data visualization techniques. The software is adaptable to client preferences by accepting a series of predetermined parameters which the client will input, and the software will use across a chain of analyses to generate a final investment portfolio. A significant component of the final recommendation is the distribution of client capital across the optimal equities selected.

From an industry perspective, we intend to provide a solution to the problem of maximizing client returns by optimizing risk and return in the case of optimal asset allocation. Clients have diverse investment goals, which is why client-driven algorithmic portfolio allocation is the basis of our project. We achieve this by having the client define their preferences according to the risk-management parameters we have defined, and further process this data to select equities from the top 200 publicly-traded companies by market capitalization in the United States. We are passionate about revealing underlying trends acrouss financial markets, being composed of a diverse group of Computer Science, Data Science and Management students.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The raw data is composed of 7 data sets of equity data that includes data on the financial accounts, valuation, performance, dividends and margins of 8115 publicly-traded companies in the United States. The data is sourced from TradingView, which grants the permission to use and distribute the data per their attribution policy cited in their Terms of Service. There are 76 data columns shared across all 7 data sets, of which 70 of them are unique. However, only 200 rows of data will be used, in which the number of columns will be significantly reduced according to their relevance in our analysis. The data sets capture static financial market data for the 30th of Januray, 2023, which can be updated by uploading new data, but for our analysis, will remain constant.
